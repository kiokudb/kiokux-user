=head1 NAME

KiokuX::User::ID - L<KiokuDB::Role::ID> integration for user objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	with qw(KiokuX::User::ID);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role provides an C<id> attribute for user objects, and self registers in
the L<KiokuDB> directory with the object ID C<user:$user_id>.

Using this role implies that user IDs are immutable.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item kiokudb_object_id

Implements the required method from L<KiokuX::User::ID> by prefixing the C<id>
attribute with C<user:>.

=item id_for_user $username

Mangles the username into an ID by prefixing the string C<user:>.

Can be overriden to provide custom namespacing.

Can also be used as a class method from the model:

	sub get_identity_by_username {
		my ( $self, $username ) = @_;

		my $object_id = MyFoo::Schema::Identity::Username->id_for_user($username);

		return $self->lookup($object_id);
	}
